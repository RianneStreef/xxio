        <h5>XXIO PRIME ROYAL EDITION men irons</h5>
        <p>
          Reap the rewards of experience with these irons crafted to meet the
          needs of golfers with moderate swing speeds. Our titanium face and new
          Speed Grooves provide higher ball speed and launch.
        </p>
        <h4>TECHNOLOGY</h4>
        <h6>REBOUND FRAME</h6>
        <p>
          Rebound Frame is an alternating pattern of stiff and flexible zones
          within the XXIO Prime RE Driver that focuses more of your impact
          energy into the golf ball. It increases ball speed and distance on
          every strike, especially center-face impacts.
        </p>
        <h6>STAANF Face Material</h6>
        <p>
          STAANF is a highly elastic and very light density titanium which helps
          increase overall COR and reposition weight deeper in each clubhead for
          a higher launch with faster ball speeds.
        </p>
        <h6>Flat Cup Face</h6>
        <p>
          For off-center strikes with the Driver, Fairway Woods, and Hybrids,
          the new Flat Cup Face expands the high COR region of each club face,
          increasing your ball speed and distance.
        </p>
        <h6>DRAW BIAS BULGE DESIGN</h6>
        <p>
          This new face curvature on the Driver, Fairway Woods, and Hybrids is
          slightly closed at the heel and open near the toe. The resulting gear
          effect helps produce a desirable right-to-left shot shape—even if the
          club face is open at impact.
        </p>
        <h6>WEIGHT PLUS</h6>
        <p>
          Weight Plus is a counterbalancing technology that places weights in
          the end of each shaft, located behind your hands as you grip the club.
          That grip weight helps push the club head up through your backswing
          for a more consistent top of swing position. And as you begin the
          downswing, the weight brings your hands into position, keeping your
          arms closer to your body for a squarer face at impact.
        </p>
        <h6>STAR FRAME</h6>
        <p>
          XXIO Prime RE’s Driver uses a Star Frame rib structure to support a
          much thinner sole than previous generations. That thinner sole allowed
          for extra mass low and deep, producing a higher launch and adding
          forgiveness off the tee.
        </p>
        <h6>LIGHTWEIGHT CONSTRUCTION</h6>
        <p>
          The new XXIO Prime SP-1100K Royal Edition Shaft, with TORAYCA T1100G
          carbon fiber and NANOALLOY resin, is extremely lightweight to help
          produce more swing speed and distance with its smooth, easy-to-swing
          profile. The softer tip section also makes it easier to close the club
          face and strike the ball square.
