        <h5>XXIO Prime Driver</h5>
        <p>
          Experience the unprecedented speed and lightweight feel of the new
          XXIO Prime Driver.
        </p>

        <h6>Luxury is Light</h6>
        <p>
          Designed to help seasoned golfers with moderate swing speeds achieve
          straight ball flight with enhanced distance, the XXIO Prime is the
          gold standard in luxury performance.
        </p>

        <h6>Performance</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Increased swing speed</li>
          <li>Added distance</li>
          <li>Straight flight</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Features</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Luxury materials</li>
          <li>Built-in forgiveness</li>
          <li>Lightweight construction</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>TECHNOLOGY</h4>
        <h6>Rebound Frame</h6>
        <p>
          Rebound Frame is an alternating pattern of stiff and flexible zones
          within the XXIO Prime Driver that focuses more of your impact energy
          into the golf ball. It increases ball speed and distance on every
          strike, especially center-face impacts.
        </p>

        <h6>Flat Cup Face</h6>
        <p>
          For off-center strikes with the Driver, Fairway Woods, and Hybrids,
          the new Flat Cup Face expands the high COR region of each club face,
          increasing your ball speed and distance.
        </p>

        <h6>Draw Bias Bulge Design</h6>
        <p>
          This new face curvature on the Driver, Fairway Woods, and Hybrids is
          slightly closed at the heel and open near the toe. The resulting gear
          effect helps produce a desirable right-to-left shot shape—even if the
          driver face is open at impact.
        </p>

        <h6>Weight Plus</h6>
        <p>
          Weight Plus is a counterbalancing technology that places weights in
          the end of each shaft, located behind your hands as you grip the club.
          That grip weight helps push the club head up through your backswing
          for a more consistent top of swing position. And as you begin the
          downswing, the weight brings your hands into position, keeping your
          arms closer to your body for a squarer face at impact.
        </p>

        <h6>Star Frame</h6>
        <p>
          XXIO Prime’s Driver uses a Star Frame rib structure to support a much
          thinner sole than previous generations. That thinner sole allowed for
          extra mass low and deep, producing a higher launch and adding
          forgiveness off the tee.
        </p>

        <h6>Super-TIX PLUS Titanium Face</h6>
        <p>
          Each XXIO Prime Driver, Fairway Wood, and Iron face is made from
          Super-TIX PLUS Titanium, an incredibly strong yet lightweight alloy
          that adds speed to all your shots.
        </p>

        <h6>Lightweight Construction</h6>
        <p>
          The new XXIO Prime SP-1100 Shaft, with TORAYCA T1100G carbon fiber and
          NANOALLOY resin, is extremely lightweight to help produce more swing
          speed and distance with its smooth, easy-to- swing profile. The softer
          tip section also makes it easier to close the club face and strike the
          ball square.
        </p>
